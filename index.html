            Week 1 8/21-8/25 - This is my first journal entry <br> On the first week of school in intro to engineering class we learned how to acess our website. We were informed about how we have a Rudy Goldberg project. This will be our first project and some other assinments we will be doing are challenges to test our knowledge.The reason I chose Intro to engineering is because I thought that this class would be cool and we could build stuff. I didn't know that we would have to write a website or learn about differnet types of mechanics.

        <br> Week 2 8/28-9/1 - This is my second journal  <br> On the second week of school we did our first challenge. There were two teams and those two teams had to bring a marable into a bucket but it ended in a draw none of us could do it. We learned about all the differnt types of mechanics in the world and took our first test. Some of the type of mechanics are thermodyanmics which focus heat. Another one is fluid mechanics which focus on piping water to houses and other places.

        <br> Week 3 9/5-9/8 - This is my third journal <br> On the Third week of school we worked more on our rude goldburg project. For this project we need to have 3 simple mechanics.Our project is going to have a incline plane then a pulley and then a lever. We also built a example of this on tinkercad. Our tinkercad is used to test if the project will work.

        <br> Week 4 9/11-9/15 - This is my fourth journal <br> On the fourth week of school I finished working on the rude goldburg project. We had to make small adjustments so we could pop the ballon easier. Our rude goldburg project is made up of cardboard, tape, string, and love. The project ended up a success, we first pushed a baseball on the pulley then that lifted a wall holding back a car that had a needle on it which then rolled off the direct plane and popped the ballon. After that we worked on our websites for the rest of the week.

        <br> Week 5 9/18-9/22 - This is my fifth journal <br> On the fifth week of school did 2 more challenges. The first one was making a paper boat out of 1 sheet of paper and tape. The goal was to make it float with as mush wieght as we could add. The second challenge was making measurements for a E and seeing if we could recreate it with the guesses mearsurments. Then we learned about the differnet types of computer programers such as software or hardware.

        <br> Week 6 9/25-9/29 - This is my sixth journal <br> On the sixth week of school we learned about computer programers. We also disessambled a PC to see all the parts. We then reassembled it and tested if it would work and ours worked! We then did an assinment that was ment for us to look for what each piece of the computer was and place it in the correct spot. One of the many pieces are GPU,CPU,Ram,etc. Then we took a test about all of this information like the moore's law or all the types of storages such as gigabytes.

        <br> Week 7 10/2-10/6 - This is my seventh journal <br> On the Seventh week of school we learned about bioengneering and we did a challenge about making a cardboard prothetic arm. Bioengineering is the application of principles of biology and the tools of engineering to create usable, tangible, economically-viable products. Making the cardboard arm taught me how arms work and how the process of making prothetics works. We then learned more of bioengneering like there careers such as biomechancics. Another thing I learned is all the organizations of bioengneering sush as ASB.
