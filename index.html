            Week 1 8/21-8/25 - This is my first journal entry <br> On the first week of school in intro to engineering class we learned how to acess our website. We were informed about how we have a Rudy Goldberg project. This will be our first project and some other assinments we will be doing are challenges to test our knowledge.The reason I chose Intro to engineering is because I thought that this class would be cool and we could build stuff. I didn't know that we would have to write a website or learn about differnet types of mechanics.

        <br> Week 2 8/28-9/1 - This is my second journal  <br> On the second week of school we did our first challenge. There were two teams and those two teams had to bring a marable into a bucket but it ended in a draw none of us could do it. We learned about all the differnt types of mechanics in the world and took our first test. Some of the type of mechanics are thermodyanmics which focus heat. Another one is fluid mechanics which focus on piping water to houses and other places.

        <br> Week 3 9/5-9/8 - This is my thrid journal <br> On the Third week of school we worked more on our rude goldburg project. For this project we need to have 3 simple mechanics.Our project is going to have a incline plane then a pulley and then a lever. We also built a example of this on tinkercad. Our tinkercad is used to test if the project will work.
